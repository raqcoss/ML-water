# Semi-Supervised Ensemble Learning Model
Repository that predicts water quality of unclassified areas in Mexico, at municipality level

It contains code, data, and visualizations for predicting **water quality** in **unclassified Mexican municipalities** using **semi-supervised ensemble learning**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The project focuses on extending water quality classification coverage across Mexico by combining a small set of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. A self-training method using ensemble classifiers (e.g., Random Forest) is implemented to label previously unclassified municipalities.
